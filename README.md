# COVID-19
This is a proof of concept for a Postman toolbox, which provides access to a list of APIs available for COVID-19, providing a curated list of APIs which are managed on GitHub, allowing others to submit to the list of APIs, or fork the entire repo and use the toolbox in their own organization.
